Pixgen is a research game program designed to bring life to pixels.

Inspired by the rules of the Game of Life.

Pixels are considered as genetic cells that try not to die.
Cells die when their energy falls to 0.

Cells can avoid this situation by feeding themselves with energy.

What is energy?
Energy comes from dead cells with passive characteristics.

Rules for living cells:
A cell is born with 100 points of energy.

A living cell can take actions:
- Move: Moving 1 pixel consumes 1 point of energy. A cell can move at a speed of 5 pixels per second.

Lifetime:
A cell's lifetime is limited; it loses 1 energy point every second.

Division:
A new cell is born next to another each time a cell's energy equals 200. Energy is equally distributed between the cells.

Starting the Game:
The game begins with the creation of initial cells. The initial setup can be defined as follows:

1. **Initial Cell Placement**:
   - Cells are randomly placed on the grid.
   - The number of initial cells can be specified by the player or set to a default value.

2. **Initial Energy**:
   - Each cell starts with 100 points of energy.

3. **Grid Size**:
   - The size of the grid can be defined by the player or set to a default size.

4. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Additional conditions, such as obstacles or energy sources, can be placed on the grid to influence cell behavior.

5. **Randomization**:
   - The initial state can be randomized to provide a unique starting point for each game session.
